Question 1
 Write a python program that finds all numbers divisible by 7 but not multiple of 5.  The range of number for searching is between 2000 and 3200 (both included). Output should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line 
 def funtion():
 	for i in range(2000, 3200, 1):
 		if i % 7 == 0 and i % 5 !=0:
 			print(i, ", ")

Question 2
 Write a python program that can compute the factorial of a given 2 numbers from the user. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Input number 1: 3 Input number 2: 4 Sample Output: 6,24

 print("input start_num1 and end_num1")
 int start_num1 = input()
 print(":")
 int end_num1 = input()
 print("\n")

 print("input start_num2 and end_num2")
 int start_num2 = input()
 print(":")
 int end_num2 = input()
 print("\n")
 int factorial1 = 1
 int factorial2 = 1
 for i in range(start_num1, end_num1, 1):
 	factorial1 *= i
 for i in range(start_num2, end_num2, 1):
 	factorial2 *= i
 print(factorial1, ",", factorial2)


 Question 3
 Define a python class which has at least two methods: 
 getString: to get a string from console input.
 printString: to print the string in upper case.
 You should also include functions to invoke the above-mentioned methods.

 class MyString:
 	def __init__(myobject, str):
 		v.str = str

 	def getString():
 		myobject.str = input("input String:")

 	def toUpercase():
 		myobject.str.upper()

 	def printString():
 		x = toUpercase()
 		print(x)

 str = MyString("string")
 str.getString()
 str.printString()
 del str


 Question 4
 Write  a  program  that  accepts  a  comma  separated  sequence  of  words  as  input  and  print  the  words  in  a  comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
 Sample input: without,hello,bag,world 
 Sample output: bag,hello,without,world

 print("Strings\n")
 words = []
 for i in range(0, 4, 1):
 	word = input()
 	print(", ")
 	words.append(word)

 for i in range(0, 4, 1):
 	for j in range(j, 4, 1):
 		if words[i] >words[j]:
 			temp = words[i]
 			words[i] = words[j]
 			words[j] = temp

 for i in range(1, 5, 1):
 	print(words[i], ", ")


Question 5
 Write a python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits in the sentence.

 print("input String")
 str = input()
 int char_num = 0
 int num_num = 0
 for i in range(0, len(str) - 1, 1):
 	if str[i] >= '0' and str[i] <= '9'
 		num_num += 1
 	if (str[i] >= 'a' and str[i] >= 'z') | (str[i] >= 'A' and str[i] >= 'Z'):
 		char_num += 1

 print("the number of charactors is ", char_num)
 print("\n")
 print("the number of numbers is", num_num)


 Question 6
 Define a function that receives two integer numbers in string form and compute their sum and print it in the console.

 print("Input 2 numbers")
 string x1 = input()
 string x2 = input()
 print("sum of 2 numbers is ")
 print(int(x1) + int(x2))


 Question 7
 Write  a  python  program  that  reads  from  a  text  file  and  print  all  the  unique  words  of  the  file  in  alphabetical order.

 f = open("readme.txt", "r")
 str = f.read()
 wordAry = str.split()
 for i in range(0, len(wordAry) - 1, 1):
 	for j in range(i, len(wordAry) - 1, 1):
 		if wordAry[i] < wordAry[j]:
 			temp = wordAry[i]
 			wordAry[i] = wordAry[j]
 			wordAry[j] = wordAry[i]
 print("Sorting Result:")
 for i in range(0, len(wordAry - 1), 1):
 	print(wordAry[i], ", ")


 Question 8
 Write a simple banking program using python that has four options: 1. View balance 2. Make a deposit 3. Make a withdrawal  4. Quit. You must implement classes and object for this program.

class Banking:
 	def __init__(myObj, account):
 		myObj.account = account

 	def getBalance():
 		return myObj.account

 	def makeDeposit(amount):
 		myObj.account += amount

 	def makeWithdrawal(amount):
 		myObj.account -= amount

 print("welcome to banking program\n")
 print("See following servies and input your favorite service's number\n")
 print("1. View balance\n2. Make a deposit\n3. Make a withdrawal\n4. Quit.")
 myAccount = Banking(1000)
 int num
 while num = input():
 	if i == 0:
 		print("Your balance is ", myAccount.getBlance())
 	if i == 1:
 		amount = input("input the amount you are going to put in: ")
 		myAccount.makeDeposit(amount)
 	if i == 2:
 		amount = input("input the amount you are going to get out: ")
 		myAccount.makeWithdrawal(amount)
 	if i == 3:
 		break
 		del myAccount


 Question 9
 Write a program that keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. Create a dictionary of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:
 Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of: Albert Einstein Benjamin Franklin Ada Lovelace Who's birthday do you want to look up? User Input : Benjamin Franklin  #Example Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706   #This your program should print

studentInfo = {"Albert Einstein" : "02/05/2000",
				"Benjamin Franklin" : "04/15/1994",
				"Ada Lovelace" : "10/25/1995"}

print("Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:\n")
print("Albert Einstein\n")
print("Benjamin Franklin\n")
print("Ada Lovelace\n")
print("Who's birthday do you want to look up?\n")
str = input("User Input :")
if str == "Albert Einstein":
	print("Albert Einstein's birthday is ", studentInfo["Albert Einstein"])
if str == "Benjamin Franklin":
	print("Benjamin Franklin's birthday is ", studentInfo["Benjamin Franklin"])
if str == "Ada Lovelace":
	print("Ada Lovelace's birthday is ", studentInfo["Ada Lovelace"])


Question 10
 Given an array of data:
 array1 105152721
 Write the code for the selection sort to sort the data and draw a table showing how the data is sorted using selection sort. 
 Write the code for Binary search algorithm to find the value 15 from the sorted array. Draw the tree diagram showing the binary search of the list.

 arry = [10, 5, 15, 2, 7, 21]
 for i in range(0, len(arry) - 1), 1)
 	for i in range(0, len(arry) - 1), 1)
 		temp = arry[i]
 		arry[i] = arry[j]
 		arry[j] = temp
 		print(arry, "\n")
